All the raw sequencing data is in the files labeled AK pool 1 and pool 2. All the demultiplexed read files from the pools are in the txt files whose name begins with their barcodes. The labels for the experimental conditions the barcodes refer to are present in the mutation analysis file. The webtool used for mutation analysis is mentioned in the methods section.
